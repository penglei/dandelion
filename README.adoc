== TODO


* more information like created time, description etc.
* executor error detail **
* query job flow status in runtime
* Runtime name(id) must be protected by lock. the runtime bootstraps with name has registered should be panic.
* use log: github.com/uber-go/zap **
* task orchestration can visit flow scheme
* save job id (offset) in flow
* FlowShapingManager can be protected by RCU
* hide internal definition
* implement DAG task orchestration
